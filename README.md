# Ruzu Pop-ups Anki Addon
Ruzu Pop-ups is an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) addon that periodically presents Anki cards using a small pop-up window.
This allows you to review Anki decks whilst working on other important tasks!
Cards from your chosen deck will periodically pop up for you to review.
